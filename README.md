# Lua / Terra syntax-highlighting for VS-Code
Syntax-highlighting based on [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) supporting lua / terra code:

* [tree-sitter-lua](https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-lua)
* [tree-sitter-terra](https://github.com/tpkessler/tree-sitter-terra-rewrite)
